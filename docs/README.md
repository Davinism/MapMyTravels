## Minimum Viable Product

MayMyTravels is a web application built using Ruby on Rails and
React/Redux and is inspired by MayMyRun. This application allows users
to mark their traveling routes on Google Maps with some pertinent data,
such as duration and budget, and creates a social networking platform
for different users to follow each other and comment on each others'
travels. By the end of Week 9, this app will, at a minimum, satisfy the
following criteria with smooth, bug-free navigation, adequate seed data
and sufficient CSS styling:

- [ ] Making traveling routes using map
- [ ] Friending
- [ ] Comments on travels
- [ ] Dashboard that tracks completed travels
